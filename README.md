ABOUT

This project seeks to provide a web-based platform for the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) to meet the demand for rapid and reliable disaster-related information. The software uses web scraping to collect real-time data from news networks, social media, and the Indian Meteorological Department. To successfully manage this data, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as SpaCy and VADER sentiment analysis are used to identify and filter information. The processed data is saved in MongoDB, which allows for easy access and real-time modifications.

One of the platform's notable features is its predictive capability, which is implemented by a combination of machine learning models. To forecast the severity, the system uses the Prophet time series model, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.about imminent natural disasters. Furthermore, PyCaret's regression models improve resource prediction accuracy, allowing for the determination of the quantity of relief required based on prior disaster data. This predictive analysis enables improved preparedness, resource allocation, and prompt intervention in disaster-prone areas.

All collected and predicted information is presented on a user-friendly dashboard, allowing disaster response agencies to swiftly access and act on important data. The platform intends to greatly increase the effectiveness of disaster response operations by delivering real-time insights and future projections, thereby saving lives and improving resource management during an emergency.
